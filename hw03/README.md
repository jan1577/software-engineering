# HW3: Java Implementation of UML State Machine Diagram

This is my solution for implementing State Machine in Java for the Elevator example (refer to HW3 Task sheet).

Task:
Add the missing elements to complete the program and then run it!
The default current_floor is 5th; run the program once with the destination floor higher, lower, and equal with the 5th floor and assess the program's behavior!
